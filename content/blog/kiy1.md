i am desperate for attention. i wasn’t always like this. i used to be the friend who didn’t ask questions, the one who listened but didn’t lean in. people loved me anyway. i don’t know why—maybe i was just easier to love when i wasn’t trying.

there was this one friend. she used to tell me how much “kiy” meant to her. i never really knew what to do with that. i never gave her much of my time. we barely talk now. not because anything ended, just because life moved, and we moved with it. she still says it sometimes, in texts that feel like notes left on a table. i read them, but i don’t know how to answer.

now kiy is desperate. desperate for attention, but not from here. because here doesn’t feel like mine. the attention i want lives somewhere else. it lives on the internet.

places on the internet for attention lovers, lmao.

chess.com is like a silent café. the kind where you only speak through the clatter of pieces. a connection that’s pure, just strategy and silence—until the game ends and you type “good game” and hope for a paragraph in return. you don’t get one. the board empties. you’re alone in the café again.

i made a friend there once. two years ago. i think he’s done with me now, lmao. but he promised he’d invite me to his wedding. so there’s that. yay.

then my brother showed me the tide pools: youtube streams with three viewers. it feels like a small, dimly lit room where the door is always unlocked. you slip inside. the streamer says your username. you type “gl hf” and they read it out loud. for sixty minutes, you’re not a ghost. you’re text on a screen. you’re a tiny, quantifiable hit of dopamine for a stranger. it’s immediate. it’s enough.

instagram is different. you have to invest attention to get it back. it’s not immediate, but it’s steady. i joined a chess group chat once. met people there who felt like characters from a story i’d started reading in the middle. crazy, kind, fleeting. i don’t know where they are now.

sometimes i think i’m just building rooms in places where no one lives. filling them with the sound of my own typing, waiting for an echo that sounds like a voice i recognize.

but tonight, it’s quiet. and i am here, and i am desperate, and i am writing this down like maybe someone will read it and understand the shape of this silence.

Living Outside the Box (While Still Very Much Trapped Inside It)

They say you shouldn’t live in a box. ( they is me here ) 
I agree. I don’t want to live in one, either.
My goal is to be the observer outside the box, watching myself go through the motions. Calm, detached, floating above the noise.

In theory, it’s perfect: I don’t give a fuck about things I can’t control. Life has no inherent purpose. 10668 days left. Why sweat the small stuff? Why care?

But here’s the truth—I do care.
I care so much . I am aware of the cosmic joke, and yet my heart still races. My stomach still drops. I still lose sleep over things that, in the grand scheme of my 10668 days, mean absolutely nothing.

It’s the ultimate contradiction: to see the box clearly, to even understand its flimsy walls, and still feel them closing in. To know that nothing really matters, but to be terrified of failing your ISA, of disappointing someone, of a tomorrow that feels uncertain.

So yes, I am philosophically “outside the box.”
But practically? I am so inside it I can touch the ceiling. I am, as they say, thoroughly cooked for ISA .

The observer and the participant, at war.
