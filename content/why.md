title: "why this exists"
---

i'm 20, and i've roughly planned my life.

finish medical training before 30. work, earn, and do things i like before 40. slow down after that. maybe do something entirely different. a smaller life. a quieter job. something like a cozy bookstore.

after that, there's no plan.

that's where the story is allowed to break (will kms)

this website exists to see what actually happens - what changes, what fails, what stays, and what replaces the original idea.

(hehe)
